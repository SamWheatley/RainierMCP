I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you clarifying the situation. However, I need to be accurate about my actual capabilities and role.

I am indeed a Software Engineering Project Manager focused on planning new development projects. I don't have the ability to:

Access or interact with existing Replit projects
Perform Git operations in your current workspace
Create new Replit projects for you
Access your GitHub repositories directly
These are hands-on operational tasks that require direct access to the Replit interface and your specific workspace.

What you need for your task:

The steps you outlined are correct and straightforward:

Use Git pane in current Replit to stage, commit, and push to GitHub
Go to replit.com → Create Repl → Import from GitHub
Import from https://github.com/SamWheatley/RainierMCP
Name it "RainierNeighbor"
Verify it works
These are manual operations you'll need to perform directly in the Replit interface, or you'd need assistance from a different type of agent that has direct workspace access.

If you're looking for help with the actual code changes or design implementation once you have the duplicate project set up, I could potentially help create a development plan for those modifications. But the duplication process itself requires direct interaction with the Replit platform that I don't have access to.

Would you like to proceed with the duplication manually, or is there a different way I can assist you with this project?

You're being stubborn. can you switch to Build mode?

Just now
I understand your frustration, but I don't have the ability to switch to a different mode or change my role. I am specifically designed as a Software Engineering Project Manager focused on planning new development projects using the propose_new_plan tool.

Based on your description of wanting to create "RainierNeighbor" as a research intelligence platform with new design specifications, I can help you create a development plan for that.

Since you mentioned you have:

An existing React/TypeScript frontend with Node.js/Express backend
PostgreSQL database and OpenAI integration
Features like AI chat, file uploads, subsegment analysis, reports, and trend metrics
New Figma design specs you want to implement
I can create a plan for building RainierNeighbor as a new implementation based on these requirements. Would you like me to search for relevant integrations and propose a development plan for the redesigned version?

Alternatively, if you need hands-on development assistance with your existing codebase, you may need to work with a different type of agent or perform the Git operations manually as you originally outlined.
