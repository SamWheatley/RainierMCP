I'll analyze the RainierNeighbor project structure and help you understand what was created from Figma, then map it to your original Rainier features. Let me examine the codebase systematically.


Analyzed project structure completeness (13 seconds)
Based on my analysis of the RainierNeighbor project, here's what was created from Figma and how it maps to your original Rainier features:

Step 1: What RainierNeighbor Created
Frontend Structure:
src/
  pages/
    └── Cover.tsx           <- Project landing/overview page
    └── not-found.tsx       <- 404 error page
  components/ui/            <- Complete shadcn/ui component library (40+ components)
  hooks/                    <- Mobile detection, toast notifications
  lib/                      <- React Query setup, utilities
Current Pages:
Cover.tsx - A project overview page showing:
Project title ("Rainier POC")
Status badge with icon
Team information
Platform, start/due dates
Uses background image and custom typography
Navigation Structure:
Router: Uses wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
Current routes: Only "/" → Cover component and fallback to 404
Missing: No complex navigation, sidebar, or multi-page structure yet
Components Available:
Complete UI Library: Accordion, Alert, Badge, Button, Card, Dialog, Drawer, Form, Input, Table, Tabs, etc.
Built on: Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling
Design System: Professional, accessible components ready to use
Backend Structure:
Express server with TypeScript
Database: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL setup
Authentication: Basic user schema (username/password)
Routes: Skeleton structure (routes.ts is mostly empty)
Step 2: Mapping to Your Original Rainier Features
What Needs Integration:
Original Rainier Feature	Current Status	Integration Needed
AI Chat Interface	❌ Missing	Create chat page + components
File Upload & Management	❌ Missing	Add upload page + backend routes
Reports Dashboard	❌ Missing	Build dashboard with data visualization
Archive/Explore	❌ Missing	Create file browser interface
Authentication	🟡 Schema only	Add login/register pages + middleware
Backend APIs	🟡 Skeleton	Implement all data processing routes
What You Currently Have:
✅ UI Component Library - Complete set of modern, accessible components
✅ Database Schema - Basic user table (needs expansion)
✅ Server Framework - Express + TypeScript setup
✅ Design Assets - Figma-generated styling and layout foundation

Step 3: Recommended Integration Plan
Would you like me to help you:

Expand the navigation structure - Add sidebar/header navigation to access all features
Create the missing pages - Dashboard, Chat, Upload, Archive pages using existing UI components
Implement backend routes - Add API endpoints for file processing, AI chat, reports
Set up authentication flow - Login/register pages with session management
Integrate data schemas - Expand database tables for files, chats, reports
Which of these would you like to tackle first? I can help you build out any of these areas using the solid foundation that was created from your Figma design.
