OK i need your help instructing ::sage:: how to prepare a report from the Come Near research data to identify Subsegments and Personas from the raw research data transcripts:
subsegments vs personas
Subsegments and personas are both tools for understanding a target audience, but they differ in purpose, scope, and level of detail. Subsegments are narrow, data-driven groups of existing customers, while personas are fictional, narrative-driven profiles that bring those customer types to life. 
Comparison: Subsegments vs. Personas
Feature 	Subsegments	Personas
Primary Goal	To target and activate specific, measurable groups within your customer base.	To build empathy and communicate a clear vision of who you are designing or marketing for.
Nature	A data-based, measurable, and functional grouping of actual customers.	A semi-fictional, human-like description of a representative customer.
Origin	Created through quantitative analysis of hard data, such as demographics, behaviors, and purchase history.	Developed through qualitative research, including interviews and surveys, to uncover motivations and goals.
Level of Detail	Broad groups defined by shared characteristics, like "high-value subscribers" or "first-time purchasers".	Highly detailed and specific descriptions that include motivations, pain points, daily lives, and personality traits.
Best Used For	Tactical, data-driven decisions like targeted ad campaigns, marketing automation, or high-level analytics.	Strategic, creative decisions like crafting messaging, designing the user experience, or guiding product development.
Example	"Customers in the Midwest who bought an item over $100 in the last 90 days."	"Financial-Planner Fiona," a 38-year-old working mother who values convenience and is motivated to simplify her household budgeting.
How to use both effectively
The most powerful approach is to use both methods together, with subsegments providing the foundation and personas adding the human element. 
Subsegments first: Use quantitative data to identify the distinct subsegments that exist within your customer base. This ensures your efforts are grounded in real data and that you understand the size and value of each group.
Personas next: Once you have identified your most important subsegments, create a representative persona for each. This qualitative step adds color and context, making the data more accessible and actionable for creative teams.
Create targeted messaging: With both in hand, you can craft messaging that not only targets the right people (the subsegment) but also speaks directly to their emotional and psychological needs (the persona).
Test and refine: Continuously monitor performance to see what resonates. A/B testing can show you which persona-based messages are most effective for each subsegment.

Here’s a tight brief you can hand to ::sage:: to produce a Subsegments → Personas report from Come Near’s raw research transcripts. It assumes the Segment Seven corpus is the initial focus and uses our sidecar metadata + weighting (Raw/Internal/Agency).

Brief for ::sage::

Goal: From Come Near research data, identify data-driven subsegments within Segment Seven and then craft personas (one per priority subsegment) grounded in quotes, behaviors, and motivations.

0) Inputs & guardrails

Corpus: Raw interview/group transcripts (speaker-labeled, timestamped), plus internal summaries and agency decks (tagged in sidecar).

Sidecar fields (required): title, doc_type ∈ {Raw, Internal, Agency}, owner, system_of_record_url, date, geo (if known), participant_id (if present).

Weights (for analysis): Raw = 1.0, Internal = 0.6, Agency = 0.4. Use Raw-only for validation views.

Privacy & permissions: Respect access levels. Quote attribution by participant_id only (no PII). Redact names/orgs.

Bias checks: Flag segments dominated by summaries/decks; surface coverage stats and caution labels.

1) Produce subsegments (quantitative first)

Objective: Find natural groupings inside Segment Seven based on expressed needs, beliefs, behaviors—not just demographics.

Steps

Preprocess

Normalize text, preserve speaker turns, keep timestamps.

Extract attributes with NER/slotting: demographics (if present), life-stage cues, religious background cues, needs/pains, behaviors (channels, practices), sentiment/affect.

Compute document + utterance embeddings (per participant and per salient quote).

Feature set (for clustering)

Concatenate: embeddings + sparse topic indicators + extracted attributes (binary/TF-IDF) + sentiment/affect scores.

Apply source weighting (Raw 1.0 / Internal 0.6 / Agency 0.4) when aggregating features per participant.

Cluster

Run HDBSCAN (preferred) or K-Means with k-selection via silhouette/DBCV.

Enforce minimum segment size threshold (e.g., ≥3–5 participants) to avoid spurious clusters.

Output: subsegment_id, size, percent_of_sample, cohesion, separation.

Label & validate

Auto-label clusters using top n-grams, key attributes, and representative quotes.

Compute coverage by source type (Raw/Internal/Agency), geo/time spread.

Flag clusters with low Raw coverage or high variance as “provisional.”

Deliverables (Subsegments)

Subsegment Cards (one per cluster) with:

Name (plain, descriptive), 2–3 line definition

Size, % of corpus, cohesion/separation scores

Distinguishing attributes (top 6–8), channels, blockers

3–5 verbatim quotes (timestamped, participant_id)

Source mix and bias flags

Comparison Table: rows=subsegments, cols=attributes (✓/—/↑↓), plus size and confidence.

Method appendix: clustering method, parameters, validation scores.

Prompt to use (high-level)

Identify natural subsegments in Segment Seven using participant-level features that combine embeddings, topics, and extracted attributes. Weight Raw transcripts 1.0, Internal 0.6, Agency 0.4. Use HDBSCAN, label clusters with plain-English names, and attach representative quotes (redacted). Compute cohesion/separation, size, and source coverage. Flag low-Raw or high-variance clusters as provisional.

2) Elevate to personas (qualitative synthesis layered on subsegments)

Objective: For the top priority subsegments (by size × distinctiveness × strategic relevance), craft human, narrative personas that creatives can use.

Selection rule

Persona Priority Score = normalized size × distinctiveness (feature separation) × strategic relevance (manual weight if provided).

Choose top 3–5 to persona-ize.

Persona template (per subsegment)

Name & snapshot: age/life-stage sketch, context.

Core motivations & values (from quotes; avoid invention).

Jobs to be done (functional, emotional, social).

Pain points & barriers (internal/external).

Beliefs & faith history (as expressed; note uncertainty).

Moments & triggers (when they’re most receptive).

Channels & touchpoints (where they actually are).

Messages that resonate / language to avoid (tie back to evidence).

Quote collage (5–8 short verbatims with timestamps).

Confidence & caveats: data coverage, recency, bias notes.

Prompt to use

For subsegment <ID/Name>, synthesize a persona. Use only grounded evidence from Raw transcripts (supplement with Internal/Agency where corroborated). Populate the template fields, keep voice neutral and precise, include a quote collage with timestamps, and add a confidence note with data coverage and recency.

3) Report structure & artifacts

Executive Summary: 1 page — number of subsegments, 3–5 key takeaways, quick implications.

Subsegments Section: cards + comparison table + bias/coverage panel.

Personas Section: 3–5 persona one-pagers (same template).

Activation Notes: suggested CTAs, content angles, and measurement ideas per persona.

Appendices: method, parameters, QA checks, glossary.

Visuals

Bubble chart (size vs distinctiveness) of subsegments.

Heatmap of attributes × subsegments.

Persona cards with quote ribbons.

4) QA, ethics, and bias checks

Raw-only view: Recompute insights on Raw-only; differences highlighted.

Coverage thresholds: Each persona must have ≥70% of evidence from Raw or be marked “provisional.”

Quote diversity: At least 3 distinct participants per persona; no single voice dominates.

Recency check: Note if a subsegment relies on older interviews; add caveat.

Faith-perspective spread: Flag if all inputs share a narrow background; note missing contrasts.

Prompt to use

Run QA: compare blended vs Raw-only outputs; measure quote diversity and recency; add bias notes wherever a subsegment/persona fails thresholds. Output a QA summary with pass/fail per check and recommended fixes.
