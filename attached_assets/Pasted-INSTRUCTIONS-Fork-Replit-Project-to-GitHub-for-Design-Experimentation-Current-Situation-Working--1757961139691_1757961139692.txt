INSTRUCTIONS: Fork Replit Project to GitHub for Design Experimentation

Current Situation:

Working Rainier research intelligence platform in Replit
Connected to GitHub repo: https://github.com/SamWheatley/RainierMCP
Need to create a copy for major design changes while preserving current stable version

Here are the new Figma specs for the project. Please call this new app RainierNeighbor
https://www.figma.com/design/g3Btf8mWFTGyVjXAa7KY3v/Rainier-POC?node-id=20-11&t=ICNTAKqi2SwlnAuY-1

Step 1: Push Current Stable Version to GitHub

Open the Git pane from Tools section in current Replit project
Stage all modified files (click the "+" next to files or use "Stage All")
Add commit message: "Complete Rainier v1 - stable version with full features"
Click "Commit"
Click "Push" to send code to GitHub repository
Verify push was successful (should see confirmation)
Step 2: Create New Replit Project for Design Experiments

Go to replit.com dashboard (new tab)
Click "Create Repl" button
Select "Import from GitHub"
Enter repository URL: https://github.com/SamWheatley/RainierMCP
Name the new project: RainierMCP-Design-v2
Click "Import"
Wait for import to complete and dependencies to install
Step 3: Verify Setup

Confirm new project runs properly (npm run dev workflow)
Test basic functionality (login, navigation, reports)
You now have two separate projects:
Original: Stable version for reference
New: Experimental version for design changes
Result: You can now make major design changes in the new project while keeping the original safe as a fallback.

I understand you want to fork your existing Replit project to GitHub and then create a new version for design experimentation based on new Figma specs. However, I need to clarify something important about my role and capabilities.

I'm a Software Engineering Project Manager focused on planning and coordinating new software development projects. I don't have the ability to directly interact with your existing Replit projects, access GitHub repositories, or perform the Git operations you've outlined.

Let me fetch the Figma design specs you provided to understand what you're trying to build for the new "RainierNeighbor" version:


Visited https://www.figma.com/design/g3Btf8mWFTGyVjXAa7KY3v/Rainier-POC?node-id=20-11
I wasn't able to access the Figma design specs directly. Let me search for information about your Rainier research intelligence platform to better understand what you're working with:


Searched the web for "Rainier research intelligence platform features"
Based on my search, it appears the "Rainier" you're referring to might be a custom research intelligence platform rather than a widely known product. Without access to your specific Figma designs and current codebase, I can help you create a plan for building "RainierNeighbor" as a new application.

However, I need more details about what you want to build. Could you provide:

What type of research intelligence platform is Rainier? (academic research, market research, scientific data analysis, etc.)

Key features of your current platform that should be carried over or redesigned

Main differences you want in RainierNeighbor based on the new Figma specs (since I couldn't access the designs directly)

Technology stack you're currently using (React, Python, database, etc.)

Once I understand these details, I can create a comprehensive plan for building RainierNeighbor with the new design specifications while helping you maintain the separation between your stable version and experimental version.
