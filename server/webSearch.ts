I can help you find current information from the web when internet access is enabled. However, the web search integration is being finalized. 

For now, I can:
1. Analyze your uploaded research documents thoroughly
2. Provide insights based on the content you've shared
3. Make inferences and connections within your data

When web search is fully active, I'll be able to:
- Find current information to supplement your research
- Cross-reference your findings with recent publications
- Provide context about industry trends and updates

Would you like me to focus on analyzing your uploaded documents in the meantime?`;
