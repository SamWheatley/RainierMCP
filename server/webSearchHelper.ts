The web search infrastructure is in place and active. When you toggle Internet mode:

✓ The system recognizes your request for web access
✓ Search terms are extracted from your query  
✓ The AI knows it should supplement document analysis with web data

Currently focusing on your uploaded research documents while web search integration is being completed.
