      "technical_content": "BREAKTHROUGH: Multi-layered JSON extraction from AI responses\n\nThe Challenge: AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok) return JSON responses with inconsistent formatting - sometimes wrapped in markdown, sometimes with explanatory text, sometimes malformed.\n\nThe Solution: A robust parsing pipeline that handles all variations:\n- Strip markdown code blocks\n- Remove text before/after JSON\n- Extract JSON using regex patterns\n- Graceful fallback to empty arrays\n\nThis pattern saved the bias and pattern insight generation that was failing silently.",
