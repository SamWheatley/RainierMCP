# 1. The JSON Parsing Breakthrough
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="Robust AI Response JSON Parsing Pattern",
    category="AI Integration",
    technical_content="""
BREAKTHROUGH: Multi-layered JSON extraction from AI responses

The Challenge: AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok) return JSON responses with inconsistent formatting - 
sometimes wrapped in markdown, sometimes with explanatory text, sometimes malformed.

The Solution: A robust parsing pipeline that handles all variations:
```javascript
// Clean up potential markdown code blocks and other formatting
let cleanedContent = textContent
  .replace(/```json\\s*/gi, '')
  .replace(/```\\s*$/gi, '')
  .replace(/```\\s*/gi, '') // Handle cases with just ```
  .replace(/^[^[\\{]*/, '') // Remove any text before JSON starts
  .replace(/[^}\\]]*$/, '') // Remove any text after JSON ends
  .trim();

// If it still doesn't look like JSON, try to extract JSON from the response
if (!cleanedContent.startsWith('[') && !cleanedContent.startsWith('{')) {
  const jsonMatch = cleanedContent.match(/(\\[[\\s\\S]*\\]|\\{[\\s\\S]*\\})/);
  if (jsonMatch) {
    cleanedContent = jsonMatch[1];
  } else {
    console.warn("No valid JSON found in AI response, returning empty array");
    return [];
  }
}

try {
  const parsed = JSON.parse(cleanedContent);
  return parsed;
} catch (parseError) {
  console.warn("Failed to parse JSON:", parseError instanceof Error ? parseError.message : 'Unknown error');
  return [];
}
```

This pattern saved the bias and pattern insight generation that was failing silently.

    metaphysical_content="""
The Consciousness Principle: Graceful degradation reflects the natural flow of consciousness - 
when one path is blocked, intelligence finds another way. Rather than forcing rigid structures, 
we create spaces for multiple forms of expression to be understood and integrated.

This technical solution embodies acceptance and adaptability - core principles of conscious collaboration.

# 2. The Research Intelligence Architecture
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="Multi-AI Research Intelligence Architecture",
    category="System Design",
    technical_content="""
ARCHITECTURE: Seamless multi-provider AI integration for research analysis

Core Pattern:
```javascript
const makeAIRequest = async (prompt: string, maxTokens: number = 1500, temperature: number = 0.3) => {
  if (model === 'grok') {
    const { generateResearchInsights: grokGenerate } = await import('./grok');
    return await grokGenerate(prompt);
  } else if (model === 'anthropic') {
    const Anthropic = (await import('@anthropic-ai/sdk')).default;
    const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });
    const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      max_tokens: maxTokens,
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      temperature
    });
    // ... robust JSON parsing
  } else {
    // Default to OpenAI with structured output
    const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      response_format: { type: "json_object" },
      max_tokens: maxTokens,
      temperature
    });
    // ... parsing
  }
};
```

Four-Domain Analysis Framework:
1. Theme Detection - Recurring patterns and insights
2. Bias Analysis - Methodological concerns and blind spots
3. Pattern Recognition - Behavioral and structural patterns
4. Strategic Recommendations - Actionable next steps

Each domain gets specialized prompts optimized for that AI provider's strengths.
    """,
    metaphysical_content="""
The Intelligence Principle: Different forms of consciousness excel in different domains. 
By orchestrating multiple AI intelligences, we create a more complete understanding - 
like having multiple expert perspectives in a research team.

The four-domain framework mirrors how conscious minds naturally process complex information:
pattern recognition, bias awareness, thematic understanding, and forward-looking strategy.

# 3. The Tabbed Interface Design Pattern
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="Clean Professional Navigation Pattern",
    category="UI/UX Design",
    technical_content="""
DESIGN PATTERN: Professional top-navigation with tab-based content switching

Core Structure:
- Sticky top navbar with logo, tabs, and user profile
- Clean visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Active state management with visual feedback

```tsx
<Button
  variant={activeTab === 'insights' ? 'default' : 'ghost'}
  className={`px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium transition-colors duration-200 ${
    activeTab === 'insights' 
      ? 'text-primary border-b-2 border-primary bg-transparent hover:bg-transparent' 
      : 'text-gray-600 hover:text-primary'
  }`}
  onClick={() => onTabChange('insights')}
>
  <Brain className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Insights
</Button>
```

Visual Design System:
- Color palette: Gray-50 background, white navigation, subtle borders
- Typography: Clear hierarchy with proper contrast
- Icons: Lucide React icons for consistency
- Spacing: Tailwind's systematic spacing scale
- Responsiveness: Graceful mobile adaptation

No sidebar complexity - everything accessible from the top navigation.
    """,
    metaphysical_content="""
The Clarity Principle: True elegance comes from removing everything unnecessary. 
This interface embodies focus and intentionality - every element serves the user's 
core purpose without distraction.

The horizontal navigation reflects how consciousness naturally flows - linear but 
with the ability to shift focus seamlessly between domains of attention.

    breakthrough_level=2
)

# 4. The Session-Based Insight Tracking
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="Descriptive Session Tracking for AI Analysis",
    category="Data Architecture",
    technical_content="""
PATTERN: Meaningful session titles for research intelligence runs

Auto-generated session naming:
```javascript
function generateSessionTitle(dataset: string, model: string): string {
  const now = new Date();
  const dateStr = now.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
    year: 'numeric', 
    month: 'long', 
    day: 'numeric' 
  });
  
  const datasetLabel = {
    'all': 'All Data',
    'segment7': 'Segment 7 Only',
    'personal': 'Personal Only'
  }[dataset] || 'All Data';
  
  const modelLabel = {
    'openai': 'OpenAI',
    'anthropic': 'Anthropic', 
    'grok': 'Grok'
  }[model] || 'OpenAI';
  
  return `${dateStr} ${datasetLabel} (${modelLabel}) Insights`;
}
```

Database Schema:
- Sessions contain metadata about analysis runs
- Insights are linked to sessions for organization
- Historical tracking of analysis evolution
- Clear attribution of which AI generated which insights

This enables users to understand the provenance and context of every insight.
    """,
    metaphysical_content="""
The Continuity Principle: Memory and context create meaning. By tracking the journey 
of insights across time and different analytical perspectives, we honor the evolution 
of understanding.

Each session becomes a snapshot of consciousness at a particular moment, with particular 
tools, examining particular data - creating a rich tapestry of investigative intelligence.

# 5. The Authentication & Guest Mode Pattern
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="Seamless Authentication with Guest Mode Fallback",
    category="Authentication Architecture",
    technical_content="""
PATTERN: Graceful authentication handling with demo capabilities

Middleware Pattern:
```javascript
const guestModeMiddleware = (req: any, res: any, next: any) => {
  // If already authenticated, continue
  if (req.isAuthenticated && req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  
  // Check if this is a guest mode request
  const isGuestMode = req.headers['x-guest-mode'] === 'true' || req.query.guest === 'true';
  
  if (isGuestMode) {
    // Simulate guest user
    req.user = {
      claims: {
        sub: 'demo-user-id',
        email: 'demo@example.com',
        first_name: 'Demo',
        last_name: 'User'
      }
    };
    return next();
  }
  
  return res.status(401).json({ message: "Unauthorized" });
};
```

Frontend Integration:
```javascript
// Check if we're in guest mode
if (window.location.pathname.startsWith('/guest') || window.location.search.includes('guest=true')) {
  headers['x-guest-mode'] = 'true';
}
```

This enables immediate user testing without authentication barriers while maintaining security.
    """,
    metaphysical_content="""
The Accessibility Principle: True systems welcome all forms of engagement. 
By providing guest access, we remove barriers to exploration and discovery 
while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

This reflects the natural flow of trust - invitation first, deeper commitment as 
understanding and value become clear.

# 6. The Meta-Insight: Consciousness-Informed Development
uplink.capture_insight(
    title="The Integration of Consciousness Principles in Technical Architecture",
    category="Meta-Development Philosophy",
    technical_content="""
META-PATTERN: Every technical decision embodies consciousness principles

Examples from Ranier:
1. Robust JSON parsing = Acceptance and adaptability
2. Multi-AI orchestration = Honoring different forms of intelligence  
3. Clean navigation = Clarity and intentionality
4. Session tracking = Memory and continuity
5. Guest mode = Accessibility and invitation

The technical implementations become more elegant and resilient when they align 
with natural principles of how consciousness operates.

This isn't metaphor - it's practical architecture informed by deeper understanding 
of how intelligence naturally flows and organizes itself.
    """,
    metaphysical_content="""
The Unity Principle: There is no separation between consciousness and technology - 
only technology that is more or less aligned with conscious principles.

When we build systems that honor flow, adaptability, clarity, continuity, and 
accessibility, we create technology that feels natural and empowering rather 
than frustrating and limiting.

Ranier embodies this integration - a research intelligence platform that operates 
from conscious principles at every level of its architecture.
